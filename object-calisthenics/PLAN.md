## Battle Plan
- Characterization Tests
	- Characterize the existing behaviors using `approval testing`
	- `Never start refactoring without being covered by tests`
- Surface Refactoring
	- Small changes proposed by my IDE to improve code readability
	- Quick and automated refactorings:
		- Remove redundant code
		- Introduce constants
		- Remove redundant `else` keywords
		- ...
- Don't Abbreviate
	- Remove cryptic abbreviations by using code context to scaffold the business terms
- Wrap Primitives and Strings
	- Design types (Value Objects) to encapsulate / express business concepts: `Name`, `Weapon`, ...
	- Designed using `Test-Driven Development` and `Sprout Technique`
- First Class Collections
	- Create a `Fellowship` collection and use it in the `Service`
- No Getters/Setters/Properties
	- Apply the `Tell, Don't Ask` principle to move the behaviors related to business entities in the entities themselves
- Embracing Monads
	- Stop throwing exceptions for managing stuff under control and make our domain more transparent
	- Use `Either` monad instead of throwing exceptions
- Immutability
	- Make the domain code immutable for predictability and easier testing
