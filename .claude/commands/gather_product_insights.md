### Gather product Insights
![Gather product Insights](https://github.com/ythirion/jurassic-code/raw/main/docs/cards/img/01.gather-product-insight.png)

I want to know which features are covered by this product.
For that purpose create a `Backlog.md` file presenting all of them in a detailed Backlog format.

For each Feature, I want :
- A title
- A description of the goal written with the `User Story` format
- Acceptance Criteria : at least one per feature. Use the Gherkin syntax to make it human readable.
  - Examples / Test Cases : each Acceptance Criteria should contain at least one key example illustrating it with test data.
