### Detail a Flow - $ARGUMENTS
![Detail a Flow](https://github.com/ythirion/jurassic-code/raw/main/docs/cards/img/03.detail-a-flow.png)

Please analyze and explain in detail the implementation of the "$ARGUMENTS" feature, tracing the full execution flow end-to-end:
- Start from the user interaction on the UI
- Go through the different components
- Include any validations, condition checks, mappings, or storage mechanisms involved
- Generate a Mermaid sequence diagram that clearly shows this entire interaction chain
- Use class/method names if possible, and include notes for side effects or business rules

Create this diagram inside a `$ARGUMENTS - flow.md` file.
