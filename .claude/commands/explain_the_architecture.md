### Explain the software architecture
![Explain the software architecture](https://github.com/ythirion/jurassic-code/raw/main/docs/cards/img/02.explain-the-architecture.png)

To better understand the system's architecture from different angles, generate a series of **C4 model diagrams** using **Mermaid syntax**.

> The C4 model offers four zoom levels — from business context down to code — making it easier to communicate software architecture clearly.

Generate **one diagram per level**, with each diagram answering a specific architectural question.
Create those diagrams inside a `C4.md` file.

### Context Diagram — *"Where does this system fit in the world?"*

- Shows the system as a black box.
- Highlights how users and external systems interact with it.
- Answers: **Who uses this system and why?**

### Container Diagram — *"What are the main building blocks?"*

- Zooms into the system to show its **major runtime units** (e.g., web app, API, DB).
- Shows how containers communicate.
- Answers: **How is the system deployed and what are its responsibilities?**

### Component Diagram — *"What lives inside each container?"*

- Zooms into one container (usually the backend).
- Shows **modules, services, controllers**, and how they interact.
- Answers: **What are the main responsibilities inside this container?**

### Code Diagram — *"What’s under the hood?"*

- Zooms into one component to show **classes, methods, or files**.
- Useful for reviewing structure, naming, and dependencies.
- Answers: **How is this component implemented?**
